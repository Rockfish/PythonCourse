Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 
============================================

Many Python packages need a C++ compiler during install. 
To get the compiler and all the system headers you need
install this package from Microsoft:

    http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266

This package contains the compiler and set of system headers necessary for 
producing binary wheels for Python packages. A binary wheel of a Python package 
can then be installed on any Windows system without requiring access to a C compiler.

The typical error message you will receive if you need this compiler package 
is 'Unable to find vcvarsall.bat'

This message appears because the Python package being installed contains the 
source code for a native extension module (.pyd), but does not have a pre-built 
copy of the module. The Python packages highlighted at pythonwheels.com have 
already been updated by their developers to include pre-built binaries, 
but many are still only available as source code.
